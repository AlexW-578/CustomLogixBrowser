# CustomColorPicker
A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that allows you to use a custom color picker instead of the default one.<br>
To use, save a color picker to your inventory and then 'favorite' it by clicking on it then the purple heart.<br>

<b>This mod requires [SpecialItemsLib](https://github.com/art0007i/SpecialItemsLib) to work</b>

## Example

I have made this example Color Picker and made it available in my public folder `neosrec:///U-Delta/R-24d26c0f-9927-4a0f-a8d0-40b55c3c2a43` under `Delta's Public\Color Picker\`<br>

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [CustomColorPicker.dll](https://github.com/XDelta/CustomColorPicker/releases/latest/download/CustomColorPicker.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Place [SpecialItemsLib.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/SpecialItemsLib/releases/latest/download/SpecialItemsLib.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
