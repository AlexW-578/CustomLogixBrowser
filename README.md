# CustomLogixBrowser
A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that allows you to use a custom logix browser instead of the default one.<br>
To use, save a logix browser to your inventory and then 'favorite' it by clicking on it then the purple heart.<br>

<b>This mod requires [SpecialItemsLib](https://github.com/art0007i/SpecialItemsLib) to work</b>

<b>This mod collides with the [CustomiseLogixBrowser](https://github.com/LeCloutPanda/Customise/tree/main/CustomiseLogixBrowser) mod by LeCloutPanda.</b>

I'm hoping to fix this at some point. Temp Fix is to disable the CustomiseLogixBrowser mod

Currently does not close when opening new logix browser but im working on an update to add an option to enable this

## Example
None yet but one on the way

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [CustomLogixBrowser.dll](https://github.com/AlexW-578/CustomLogixBrowser/releases/latest/download/CustomLogixBrowser.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Place [SpecialItemsLib.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/SpecialItemsLib/releases/latest/download/SpecialItemsLib.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.

## Thank you!
Many thanks to [XDelta](https://github.com/XDelta) for creating the [CustomColourPicker](https://github.com/XDelta/CustomColorPicker) mod which this mod is based off
