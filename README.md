# CustomProtofluxBrowser
A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows you to use a custom protoflux browser instead of the default one.<br>
To use, save a protoflux browser to your inventory and then 'favorite' it<br>

<b>This mod requires [SpecialItemsLib](https://github.com/art0007i/SpecialItemsLib) to work</b>

## Example
TBD


## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [CustomProtofluxBrowser.dll](https://github.com/AlexW-578/CustomProtofluxBrowser/releases/latest/download/CustomProtofluxBrowser.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Place [SpecialItemsLib.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/SpecialItemsLib/releases/latest/download/SpecialItemsLib.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder.
4. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
5. Create and Fav a protoflux Browser.
6. Profit
