# CustomProtofluxBrowser
A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows you to use a custom protoflux browser instead of the default one.<br>
To use, save a protoflux browser to your inventory and then 'favorite' it<br>

<b>This mod requires [SpecialItemsLib](https://github.com/art0007i/SpecialItemsLib) to work</b>

## Example
Link to Folder containing some custom browsers: 

`resrec:///U-AlexW578/R-1A443BEFD14226E18C5EAD234D8F5C5B1BB01990D7F32DF1B6336550BD3FD3F3`

`resdb:///d4573a54d40473fc85497549e513f47f4d2ed7f2798f8121dc34cd5bfc5c0e97.brson` - ProtoFlux Browser 'Neos' Edition (by Nuka)

`resrec:///U-Sinduy/R-554A1DA6B5B5E8075EC0B735EE020F6CA823B3D1A778C53231065E8BB840A07B` - ProtoFlux Browser with CharryPicks (by Sinduy)

If you would like your browser in the folder send a message/issue.


## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [CustomProtofluxBrowser.dll](https://github.com/AlexW-578/CustomProtofluxBrowser/releases/latest/download/CustomProtofluxBrowser.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.

4. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.

6. Profit
